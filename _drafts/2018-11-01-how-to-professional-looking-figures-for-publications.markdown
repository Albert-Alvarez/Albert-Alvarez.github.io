The **world of scientific publications** (books, journals, presentations, articles, etc.) **is very conservative**. There is no room for a graphic design evolution, personal styling, heterogeneity,... Sometimes, there is even no room for color! A picture is worth a thousand words. Below you can find a comparison between the [cover of the first issue of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal#/media/File:Nature_cover,_November_4,_1869.jpg){:target="_blank"} from 4 November 1869 (left) with the current (2018) `[manuscript template for conference proceeding](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html){:target="_blank"} that we have to use to publish (right).

I try to fight this "conservatism" through my presentations during conferences, where major "freedom" is allowed, playing with the typography, color, branding, media, etc. But **in articles... seems that this evolution won't take place in the near futur**: the font is fixed (New Times Roman), the grid is defined (double column), the color is set (black over white), size is always A4 or US letter. So... **where can we try to focus our efforts** to improve the looking of our article? The answer is **figures**.

# What is a professional-looking figure

If someone shows us a paper with poor quality figures together with one with professional-look figures, I think that we all would recognize wich is the one with the professional-look figures. A professional-look is something that we can recognize it because we have interiorized it, but we don't repair in what aspects must we have into account to achieve this professional-look.

There are so many aspects that we must take into account to achieve professional-look figures, but, for me, these are the basic characteristics that a figure must have to achieve it:

- **Perfect formal formatting:** You can apply the last tendences in graphic design to your figures or use the most modern formats, but, if the figure doesn't follow the formal aspects for figures in a scientific report, your figure won't look professional. Here we are talking about: axis with labels and units, correct number formatting in axis (correct decimal precision), to use point or line graphs appropriately, etc.

- **Typography according to the main theme:** The font must follow the theme's font (it doesn't mean that it must be the same than from body text). But, I think that we all can see that a combination of New Times Roman for the body text together with Comic Sans for figures is not so... professional... Quick tip: To be on the safe side, use to your figures the same font from the body text.

- **Be ready for colorless media:** Must be ready to be printed in grayscale. A high proportion of scientific publications are published online (no problem with color) and in black and white paper-based publications. Prepare your figures to be comprehensible/meaningful in absence of color.

- **Proper image resolution:** The figure looks well regardless its size. That is, we can print it in a DinA4 sized paper, show it in a presentation, print it in a B5 book or print it in a DinA0 poster.

In this last point ios where I'm going to center this post, because is the weakest point in major scientific papers I have
