In recent years a large number of degrees have appeared in the scientific-technical field, many of them are engineering degrees. These new emerged engineering degrees are characterized by its transversality and its interdisciplinarity. A clear example is the Biomedical Engineering (BE), a profile that presents an increased demand within the educational, scientific and industrial communities. So, the mixing of different disciplines involves complex teaching approaches of the curriculum courses. In this work, the challenges related to the learning and teaching process with a rapidly evolving discipline like BE is discussed. A Problem-based learning (PBL) methodology is presented to address the issue of multi-disciplinary teaching, in this case applied to basic learning of electronic instrumentation.
