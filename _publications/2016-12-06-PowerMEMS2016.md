Ambient energy harvesting coupled to storage is a way to improve the autonomy of wireless sensors networks. Moreover, in some applications with harsh environment or when a long service lifetime is required, the use of batteries is prohibited. Ultra-capacitors provide in this case a good alternative for energy storage. Such storage must comply with the following requirements: a sufficient voltage during the initial charge must be rapidly reached, a significant amount of energy should be stored and the unemployed residual energy must be minimised at discharge. To answer these apparently contradictory criteria, we propose a selfadaptive switched architecture consisting of a matrix of switched ultra-capacitors. We present the results of a self-powered adaptive prototype that shows the improvement in terms of charge time constant, energy utilization rate and then energy autonomy.
