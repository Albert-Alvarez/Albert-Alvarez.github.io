Sensor technologies and applications are evolving rapidly driven by the demand for new sensors for monitoring and diagnostic purposes to enable improvements in human health and safety. Simultaneously, sensors are required to consume less power, be autonomous, cost less, and be connected by the Internet of Things. New sensor technologies are being developed to fulfill these needs. This book reviews the latest developments in sensor technology and gives the reader an overview of the state-of-the-art in key areas, such as sensors for diagnostics and monitoring.
