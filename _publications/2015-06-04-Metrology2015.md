This manuscript presents a Piezoelectric Harvester based on a novel analog control unit to assures a maximum power transmission. Also in this paper it is presented a study of the transferred power between the piezoelectric generator and a load based on data obtained by simulation and experimentally. In addition, results of experimental test of the system for its application as Structural Health Monitoring is presented.
