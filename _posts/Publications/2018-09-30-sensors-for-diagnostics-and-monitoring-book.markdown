I am pleased to announce the publication of the new book **"Sensors for diagnostics and monitoring"** where we have collaborated writing one of its chapters. This book is focused in the **state-of-the-art** in sensors for **human health** and **safety** areas. A review on recent developments in sensor technology, in terms of **power consumtpion**, **cost**, **autonomy** and **connectivity**, is presented.

## Low Power Energy Harvesting Solutions for Smart Self-Powered Sensors

We have collaborated writing the 9th chapter of the book which title is **"Low Power Energy Harvesting Solutions for Smart Self-Powered Sensors"**. In this chapter we present a review of common practices and last developments in the field of **energy harvesting** that are used to power smart **self-powered** sensors. The chapter is focused in **sub-watt** energy harvesting solutions to power the, no longer future, nodes for Internet of Things or Wireless Sensor Networks.

This work covers from the different **energy harvesting sources available** to power the final solution (from thermoelectrics to piezoelectrics, through solar light, fuel cells or wind energy) to techinques to maximize the power extracted from them, aka **Maximum Power Point Tracking** algorithms. The review is also accompanied with the **most recent examples of application** and a proposal for an **ideal multi-source self-powered device**.
